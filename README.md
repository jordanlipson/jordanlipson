### Hi, I'm Jordan (she/her) 😊

I'm a first-year CS student and I'm currently in the process of exploring my different interests within tech.

- 👩🏻‍🎨 I have a **personal website** in the works
- 👩🏻‍💻 Catch me at hackathons!

Outside of school and projects, I'm obsessed with learning (spoken) languages. I speak 6 (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Cantonese) at varying levels and it's what I spend most of my free time doing. 🗣

Feel free to reach out and connect on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-lipson)!
