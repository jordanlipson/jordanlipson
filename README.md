### Hi, I'm Jordan (she/her) ðŸ˜Š

I'm a second year cognitive science (former CS) student with a love for product design/management. 

Outside of school and projects, I'm obsessed with learning (spoken) languages. I speak English, French, Spanish, and German at varying levels and it's what I spend most of my free time doing. ðŸ—£
