### Hi, I'm Jordan (she/her) 😊

I'm a first-year CS student with a love for UX/UI + product design. 

- 👩🏻‍🎨  I have a **personal website** in the works
- 🤳🏻  I'm working as a UX/UI intern at Kynza this summer
- 👩🏻‍💻  Catch me at hackathons!

Outside of school and projects, I'm obsessed with learning (spoken) languages. I speak 6 (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Cantonese) at varying levels and it's what I spend most of my free time doing. 🗣
